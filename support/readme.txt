This folder contains the support functions per individual team member.
This folder also contains a folder *data* where data can be stored.
Please try keep the data folder to a minimum (Heroku only allows 500 Mb)

There is a scratch[team member name].py which you can use to test your part 
independently on your own computer without messing up the others workflow and functions.
If you see someone else has a function, please do use it :-)

Good coding practice here is that one shouldnt use functions in their scratch[name].py file, this is a volatile 
file and all the individual contributions will be accumalated in the app.py file (which Kirodh will do). All functions 
fall part of [name].py file.

Dont worry about styling css (i.e. the website produced) too much, I will do this on an overall level [if youre curious, 
the css style file is in the assets folder]. Rather your content is very important :-)

I pretty much done all the skeleton work for you, all you need to do is produce graphs.
The graphs should update according to the dt.datetime.today() and then show the forecast from this date into the future.
How you do this (buttons, sliders, calander pop-up) I dont mind.
